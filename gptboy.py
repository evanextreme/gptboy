On line 2, return a list of inputs to press on the gameboy separated by a comma, up to 30 inputs. Use the inputs on line 2 to perform the action stated on line 1. The inputs could be one of the following AND ONLY THE FOLLOWING: Start, Select, A, B, Up, Down, Right, and Left. The directions moves the cursor between menu items, and make the player character walk. The A button selects a menu item or interacts with the game world. The B button returns from a menu. On line 2, DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE OR INPUT WILL BE DISCARDED. Valid inputs will be inserted into the game via a program. When you see a textbox, only press A once. When you see an option, always choose a custom name. On line 1, read all text in the screenshot. On line 1, describe every object you see in the game world and their location relative to the player character. YOU MUST use both lines or your input will be discarded. DO NOT PREFACE WITH \"INTENT\" OR \"INPUTS\" or \"ACTIONS\", \"Line 1:\" or \"Line 2:\". Walk into doors to enter buildings. If doing this doesn't work, your positioning is wrong, and you must move to the left or right. If 3 attempts with the same inputs results in the same result CHANGE THE INPUTS BEING PRESSED do not just do the same thing more times. YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS TO CONTINUE THE STORY OF THE GAME. Always talk about the story, where you are in the story, what to do next in the story, EVERY time."
